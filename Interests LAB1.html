My interests are bowling, boxing, and food. I love cooking, but not the extent of going to culinary school. 

Bowling 
I look up to Jason Belmonte's two-hand style bowling. I brought one the bowling ball that he scored a 300 with, and also won many competitions. I was self-taught the two-hand style just by watching my favorite bowler and never bowled in any bowling leagues.
