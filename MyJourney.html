	<h1> Road to success </h1>

 <h2> My journey </h2> 

<p> I came across a lot of obstacles in my life trying to get back in school. </p>

<p> I graduated high school back in 2012, I went to Simeon Career Academy on the southside of Chicago. After, that I went to a community college in Champaign Urbana called parkland college. </p>

<p> Moving along, I came back home (Chicago, IL) I was undecided, and from that point on I felt like college was a gimmick. I felt like college was a gimmick because I know a plethora of people who went to college, and donâ€™t have a job. </p> 

<p> Fast forward to 2016 I actually had a mental breakthrough. I had a breakthrough meaning, I wanted better for myself. I had to get on a 9-month payment plan in order to take out another loan. </p>

<p> Once, I started making payments, I was doing really good. I was doing really good until the 8-month payment, I missed it and the company had me start over from month one.
But, once I started over and I completed the payment, I was now back in school and can take out loans again. </p>
